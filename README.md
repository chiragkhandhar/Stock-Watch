## What is Stock Watch and why do I care?

I have been waiting long enough for a simplistic Android Stock Monitoring app to come so I
decide to create one myself. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Robinhood, TD Ameritrade Mobile, Acorns are great apps. 
I have used them and I will continue to use them in the future. However, they are primarily designed for trading and you can't use them unless and until you signup and provide your Bank and SSN details.
Thus, I wanted an App which allows me to add my choice of Stocks that I wish to monitor on my dashboard, and should be able to give the latest real-time prices. No Sign-Ups, no advertisements, simply plug and play.  Most importantly,
it had to be blazingly fast and simplistic to everyone. 

So here comes the ‚ÄúStock Watch‚Äù üéâ.

* Material Design.
* Blazingly fast and lightweight.
* Dark Mode.
* No Sign Up.
* No Bank/SSN/Personal Details.
* Plug and Play.
* Local Storage.
* No Ads, No Pop-ups.
* Real-time Prices.
* Major Cryptocurrency Support.
* [Market Watch](https://www.marketwatch.com/) integration for individual stock.
